# Code of Conduct

The Scikit-Criteria project adheres to the
[Quatrope Code of Conduct](https://www.quatrope.org/coc) in order to create a
safe and welcoming community for all individuals. We believe that inclusivity
and respect are essential values that should be upheld in all interactions and
discussions.

As a project, we are committed to creating an environment that is free from d
iscrimination, harassment, or any other behavior that violates the Quatrope
Code of Conduct. We expect all members of our community to follow these
guidelines and contribute to creating a positive and supportive environment.

If you witness or experience any behavior that violates the Quatrope Code of
Conduct within the project, please report it to the project organizers
immediately. We will take appropriate action to address the situation and
ensure that all members of our community feel safe and supported.

Thank you for being a part of the project and helping us to create a culture
of inclusivity and respect.
